# Other Regression Types - Detailed Explanation

## Overview
While linear regression is fundamental, there are many other regression techniques that can handle more complex relationships and provide better performance in specific scenarios.

## 1. Polynomial Regression

### What is it?
Polynomial regression extends linear regression by considering polynomial relationships between features and the target variable.

### Mathematical Foundation
**Equation**: y = b₀ + b₁x + b₂x² + b₃x³ + ... + bₙxⁿ

### When to Use
- When the relationship between features and target is non-linear
- When you can visualize a curved relationship in scatter plots
- When linear regression shows poor performance

### Advantages
- Can capture non-linear relationships
- Still uses linear regression underneath (easy to implement)
- Good for polynomial-shaped data

### Disadvantages
- Can easily overfit with high degrees
- Sensitive to outliers
- Can become unstable at the edges of data range

## 2. Ridge Regression (L2 Regularization)

### What is it?
Ridge regression adds a penalty term to the linear regression cost function to prevent overfitting.

### Mathematical Foundation
**Cost Function**: MSE + α * Σ(βᵢ²)
- α (alpha) = regularization parameter
- Higher α = more regularization

### When to Use
- When you have many features
- When multicollinearity is present
- When linear regression overfits

### Advantages
- Reduces overfitting
- Handles multicollinearity
- Can use all features (doesn't eliminate any)

### Disadvantages
- Requires hyperparameter tuning (α)
- Doesn't perform feature selection
- Less interpretable than simple linear regression

## 3. Lasso Regression (L1 Regularization)

### What is it?
Lasso regression adds a penalty term that can shrink coefficients to exactly zero, performing automatic feature selection.

### Mathematical Foundation
**Cost Function**: MSE + α * Σ|βᵢ|
- Can eliminate features by setting coefficients to 0

### When to Use
- When you want automatic feature selection
- When you have many features, some irrelevant
- When interpretability is important

### Advantages
- Automatic feature selection
- Reduces overfitting
- Creates sparse models (fewer features)

### Disadvantages
- Can be unstable with correlated features
- May arbitrarily select one feature from correlated group
- Requires hyperparameter tuning

## 4. Elastic Net Regression

### What is it?
Combines both Ridge (L2) and Lasso (L1) regularization.

### Mathematical Foundation
**Cost Function**: MSE + α₁ * Σ|βᵢ| + α₂ * Σ(βᵢ²)

### When to Use
- When you want benefits of both Ridge and Lasso
- When you have groups of correlated features
- When Lasso is too aggressive in feature selection

### Advantages
- Combines benefits of Ridge and Lasso
- Better handling of correlated features than Lasso
- Can select groups of correlated features

### Disadvantages
- More hyperparameters to tune
- More complex than Ridge or Lasso alone

## Comparison Summary

| Method | Feature Selection | Handles Multicollinearity | Non-linear | Regularization |
|--------|------------------|---------------------------|------------|----------------|
| Linear | No | No | No | No |
| Polynomial | No | No | Yes | No |
| Ridge | No | Yes | No | L2 |
| Lasso | Yes | Partial | No | L1 |
| Elastic Net | Yes | Yes | No | L1 + L2 |

## Implementation Steps (General)
1. **Data Loading**: Load and explore the dataset
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, scaling
3. **Feature Engineering**: Create polynomial features (if needed)
4. **Data Splitting**: Train/test split
5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Find optimal regularization parameters
6. **Model Training**: Fit the regression model
7. **Evaluation**: Calculate performance metrics
8. **Visualization**: Plot results and compare models

## Key Considerations

### Hyperparameter Tuning
- Use cross-validation to find optimal parameters
- Grid search or random search for parameter exploration
- Consider using automated tools like GridSearchCV

### Feature Scaling
- Essential for regularized regression (Ridge, Lasso, Elastic Net)
- Polynomial features can have very different scales
- Use StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler

### Model Selection
- Compare multiple regression types
- Use validation curves to understand parameter impact
- Consider the bias-variance tradeoff

### Overfitting Prevention
- Monitor training vs validation performance
- Use regularization appropriately
- Consider the complexity of polynomial degree
